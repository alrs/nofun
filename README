nofun
-----
nofun is a traditional UNIX filter that strips escape sequences from input on 
stdin before sending to stdout.

nofun rids you of colors, spinners, and their associated ESC trash.

One could do this with GNU sed, but developers working in proprietary
operating systems don't have GNU sed.
